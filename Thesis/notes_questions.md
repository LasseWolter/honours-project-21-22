# Questions

- Is it clear what strongly vs. weakly labeled data means? -> Do I need to explain that?
- Should I include things about things that took some time for me?
  - e.g. that I haven't used the MLP cluster before and needed to understand how to work with it
- If I rewrite code from scratch, how detailed should I explain why their code wasn't the best?
