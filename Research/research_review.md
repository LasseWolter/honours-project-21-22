Quote from intro:
AED = Audio Event Detection
> Historically, AED has been addressed with features such as
> MFCCs and classifiers based on GMMs, HMMs, NMF, or SVMs
> [8, 9, 10, 11]. More recent approaches use some form of DNN,
> including CNNs [12] and RNNs [13].

- using Youtube-100M
- 70M vids - 5.24M hours  
- 30K labels

- whole soundtrack classification
    - assign one keyword to a whole video

**The Benefit Of Temporally-Strong Labels In Audio Event Classification**

-uses https://research.google.com/audioset/download_strong.html dataset
- which describes clips of varying length - manually chosen by annotators

### Questions
- Which paper first used CNNs instead of other techniques for audio classification?
