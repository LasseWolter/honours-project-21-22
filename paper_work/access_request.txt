Subject: Access to GPU Teaching Compute Cluster + Increasing Disk Quota 

Dear Computing Support,

could you please grant access to the Teaching Compute Cluster to the following student as well as increase his disk quota by 10GB:
- Lasse Wolter (s1660656)

Reason for that is his Honours Project called "A Zoom filter for applause and laughter" which I am supervising. The project is about developing a machine learning algorithm to automatically classify laughter and applause in real time. 
Thus, sufficient computing power for training/testing such a model is needed. The increase of disk quota is due to the fact that Pytorch's GPU version alone is around 4-5GB. For some local testing on a single GPU machine Pytorch's GPU version is needed. 

Best wishes, 

Philip Wadler
