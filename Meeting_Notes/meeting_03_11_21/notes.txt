- how does the 'min_length' parameter influence user experience
  - latency? 
  - possibly use a buffer 

- security concern:
  - especially if we want high recall, people's audio will be let through a lot
    - e.g. don't want that to happen when I have a conversation with my wife

- tolerance values at start and end of a frame
  - check literature for recommended values for this 

- change code to evaluate threshholds more efficiently 
  - don't run the whole model prediction again

THESIS
- add more detail 
  - I (Ondrej) should be able to reproduce the experiments
- add a section for evaluation metrics
- explain methods rather than citing specific outcomes like (EER=9.22)
  - one can add a table with results like this at the end of the paragraph
