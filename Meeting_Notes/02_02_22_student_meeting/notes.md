# Questions asked

- why couldn't you use Gillick et al.'s model for real-time processing?

- how close to real-time can Gillick et al.'s model work?

  - _task for me_: what RTF would be needed to be evaluated okay
    - it's not just RTF but also other constraints
      - which ones? Show that clearly with numbers

- What hinders Gillick et al.'s model from being 'more real-time'?

# Alternative approach to laughter detection in large meetings:

- find positions where lots of people make noise at the same time and feed through that audio
  - it's unlikely that all of them have an ambulance passing by at the same time

# Possible enhancement

- tell people before a meeting that you are using such a system and because of that they should laugh more expressively
  - person who said this said that they would happily do that
