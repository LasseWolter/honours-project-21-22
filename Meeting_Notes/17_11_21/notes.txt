- switchboard dataset has 8khz / ICSI has 16khz
  - possibly data missmatch -> yields low recall

- Next steps: 
  - retrain on ICSI
  - calculate real-time factor
    - 'time to process data'/'duration of the data'

- use current model as baseline 1 
  - compare model retrained on ICSI to this baseline
    - then take that model as baseline 2
      - when trying to make model more real-time use baseline 2 for comparison

- possibly shift window to not take 50% before and 50% after 
  - e.g. 75% before and 25% after?

- state the practical-example-table from presentation close to beginning of the thesis
  - then show how much you improved from there
