The key is to recognise when you are stuck and ask for help, instead of banging your head against the wall.

Important: Have the practical side in mind
    -> it's a difficult project and you might not succeed at all
    -> very simple prototype at first (asap) and improve from there
            -> "Do the worst possible job first and then improve on that"
    -> improving your project later on makes a great story for the report
        -> "I started like this and look how much I managed to improve it"
