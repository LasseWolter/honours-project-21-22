- plot prec-recall curve without sigmoid applied

  - should give you values from precision=1 to recall=1
  - (sigmoid squashes this)

- try to overfit deliberately to show that the model works

  - large enough ML models are able to overfit random data
  - if my model can't there is something wrong with the model

- draft in two weeks should be YOUR BEST SHOT

  - NOT just a draft

- combination of different metrics makes for a rigourous analysis
  - maybe not 'evaluation' but analysis
  - combination of prec-recall and confusion matrix (as well as loss and accuracy)
