- Optimisation while loading audio files 
  - shouldn't load file twice when there are several laughter segments in it

- subsampling is reasonable to get a fixed input length
  - the sample duration is determined by the context window 
    - need to think about this and see how it's done in the current model

- use single file while developing the ML-pipeline
  - fast feedback until everything works fine
  - then use larger dataset
    - if you can use whole dataset -> more data = better
    - possibly they only used subsets of the ICSI data because of computational limitations back then
