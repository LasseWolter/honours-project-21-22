Goal: Get more information about the project and see if I'm suitable
------------------------------------------------------------
PREPERATION
------------------------------------------------------------
FIRST: Do you have any questions/concerns? 

- keen on taking MLPR
- check existing filters + papers
- ML Pipeline is part of the project: How important? 
- Software Engineering part: build a way to extract, analyse and modify sounds of streaming video that integrates into a platform like Jitsi
    -> Building a solid framework for this would allow ML Pipeline to be improved in the future

- Constraints for ML algorithm
    -> FAST - almost immediate reaction
    -> LOW COMPUTATIONAL COST - run on low-power-machines

ADVICE FROM ANDRE
- for speech 10h of training data is needed 
- Possible Training data: Audio-set(from Google and MIT) - labled data
- Testset: Rather not getting one from clowdr but testing it with them LIVE
    -> For livetesting: Fallback mode: only show corresponding emote (instead of unmuting)

- Possible ML-Frameworks: 
    -> for speech processing: Caldi
    -> more general: Tensor flow / Pytorch
- development approach:
    -> Simple baseline - easy to implement like Naive Bayes
    -> then compare more advanced methods to that 
    
- Possibly interesting courses: 
    -> Speech Processing
    -> ASR: Automated Speech Processing
