# Log:

### Wednesday, 27.10.21

- Running experiments for first 5 `Bed`-Meetings with
  - min_length = 0.2s
  - thresholds = 0.1, 0.2..., 0.9
- Script for downloading `Bed`-Meetings is

### Thursday, 28.10.21

- Realised that 9 different thresholds for each channel will take a long time
  - After some manual testing decided on 4 thresholds (0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8) for further testing
- Running experiments for `Bed`-Meeting 6-11 with 4 thresholds each

- created simple 'splay'-bash-function which allows to play .shp files directly

```
# play sph file
splay() {
  sph2pipe "$1" > "out.wav" && play "out.wav" "${@:2}";
}
```

- Textgrid has following format:

```
xmin = 0.0
xmax = 3491.7732565980336
tiers? <exists>
size = 1
item []:
    item [1]:
        class = "IntervalTier"
        name = "laughter"
        xmin = 0.0
        xmax = 3491.7732565980336
        intervals: size = 6
            intervals [1]:
                xmin = 0.0
                xmax = 1092.9973749000299
                text = ""
            intervals [2]:
                xmin = 1092.9973749000299
                xmax = 1093.5322345758389
                text = "laugh"
            intervals [3]:
                xmin = 1093.5322345758389
                xmax = 2956.3089568076443
                text = ""
            intervals [4]:
                xmin = 2956.3089568076443
                xmax = 2957.0996189371012
                text = "laugh"
            intervals [5]:
                xmin = 2957.0996189371012
                xmax = 3490.9128301630367
                text = ""
            intervals [6]:
                xmin = 3490.9128301630367
                xmax = 3491.7732565980336
                text = "laugh"
```

- all laughter events are in one item/IntervalTier with name `laughter'
- the interval size of this tier is double the size of laugther events
  - includes intervals between two detected laughter-events
- if the interval text=="laughter" we have a laughter event:

  - xmin and xmax give the boundaries of this event

- concat all chan4\*.wav files with in between sound (break.wav)

  - bash:

  ```
    sox $(for f in chan4*.wav; do echo -n "$f break.wav "; done) output.wav
  ```

  - allows for easier manual evaluation

- **Question**: If you evaluate manually you might get different impression
  - laugh events that occur directly next to speech will not be considered correct
    when evaluated automatically (since we filtered for laugther-without-speech in transcripts)
    - when listening to them manually keeping them might be desirable

### Friday, 29.10.21

- Moved already analysed meeting files (Bdb, Bed) to archive folder on DFS
  - Then removed them from all scratch disks on the cluster
- Downloaded new meeting files (Bmr) to the DFS
- Created experiment scripts for the first 10 Bmr-meetings
  - run those experiments with 4 different thresholds
- ran experiments remaining Bmr-meetings
- ran experiments for meetings up to Bro014

### Saturday, 30.10.21

- Copied outputs up from DFS to AFS
  - currently got output up to Bro014
- Run experiments for Bro15 up to Bro28
- Run experiments for remaining meetings (Bsr, Btr, Buw)

### Tuesday, 02.11.21

- code cleanup/refactor
  - changed module structure for clearer code
  - added analyse.py: for analysing the results of the predictions
- Added to laughs_to_wav.py to also allow reading from csv files
  - thus, steps to get laughter wavs from transcript are:
    1. parse transcript into pandas dataframe
    2. write pandas dataframe to .csv
    3. run laughs_to_wav.py on this .csv
- used code above to generate breath-laugh audios (see `output_processing/Buw_breath_laugh/`)
  - imo, they shouldn't be considered for our project

# Friday, 05.11.21

- decided against the portion library for representing intervals
  - I feel like the interval library would be overkill https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/portion and just add unnecessary complexity to the code
  - The solution using sets seems simpler and sufficient for our project.
    IDEA for solution using sets:
- Turn each predicted laugh segment into a set of laugh frames
- Turn each transcribed laugh segment into a set of laugh frames
- Turn all invalid segments (where laugh occurs next to speech) into a set of invalid frames
  - granularity should be defined according to existing literature
- union all laugh frames of a particular channel
- subtract all invalid frames
- correctly predicted frames = intersection of predicted and transcribed frames

CORRECTION:

- this idea can quite nicely be realised using closed intervals from the Portion library
- first dirty version is implemented and works

  - but a lot slower than before: need to look at performance
  - recall and precision both went up a bit but recall is still very low: need to investigate this further

- For future experiments change the `get_laughter` function in laugh_segmenter to allow faster processing of several thresholds/min_lengths

- Should filter out events shorter than min_length from evaluation?

  - I included that but doesn't make a big difference

- Highest 20 recalls can be seen here:
- **73.32%** is the maximum...need to investigate further

```

- after printing out the total predicted and total transcribed times it's very
  quite obvious why the recall is so low. The total predicted time is way lower.
  If the tot_pred_time is only half of the tot_tranc_time this means that we can get
  a maximum of 50% recall... need to investigate this further

# Saturday, 06.11.21

Comparing new set method including removed mixed_laugh_segements to original method
(indices are odd because I removed the thresholds 0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9 due to small amount of data)

```
**Original** method:
threshold precision recall
mean mean
1 0.2 0.154860 0.312307
3 0.4 0.344310 0.175887
5 0.6 0.515102 0.078559
7 0.8 0.650163 0.029492

**New** method:
threshold precision recall
mean mean
1 0.2 0.173080 0.352611
3 0.4 0.373184 0.193568
5 0.6 0.543314 0.083950
7 0.8 0.667196 0.030589
```

**MADE A MISTAKE HERE**

- the new method wasn't properly exectued since the tot-pred-length was still taken to be the length of all predictions
  instead of only the valid ones after subtracting the 'mixed-laughs'
- if this is changed the precision goes up significantly

```
  threshold precision recall
  mean mean
  1 0.2 0.205677 0.352611
  3 0.4 0.494141 0.193568
  5 0.6 0.747847 0.083950
  7 0.8 0.904399 0.030589
```

**Outcome**

- recall and precision increase, but recall is still very low
- both versions still represented in code (as OLD version and NEW version)
- do further checkup on this

### Comparing inclusion vs. exclusion of breath-laugh (before above mistake was fixed)

#### Before fixing mistake above

```
**Including breath-laugh**
threshold precision recall
mean mean
1 0.2 0.173080 0.352611
3 0.4 0.373184 0.193568
5 0.6 0.543314 0.083950
7 0.8 0.667196 0.030589
tot length: 14714.835000000001
tot events: 8714

**Excluding breath-laugh**
threshold precision recall
mean mean
1 0.2 0.171825 0.374076
3 0.4 0.372363 0.206755
5 0.6 0.542973 0.089204
7 0.8 0.667171 0.032287
tot length: 13837.871000000003
tot events: 7902
```

**Outcome**

- 812 'breath-laugh'-events were excluded
- recall increases slightly with little variation in precision
- **still**, recall is very low
  - There must be a different reason for this

#### After fixing mistake above

```
**Including breath-laugh**

```

**Outcome**

- slight improve in recall
- **still**, recall is very low
  - There must be a different reason for this

# Monday - Thursday, 8-11.11.21

- improved parts of Thesis bg-chapter according to feedback
  - reread Knox and Mirghafori and added more detail about it
  - found out that 3 of the cited papers that use ICSI, actually use the Bmr-subset of the ICSI corpus

# Friday 12.11.21

- Looked over some general AED-papers to look for latency factors of real-time AED

  - ideas:
    - decoding?
    - buffer size/window size
      - if 1s around the frame is considered we need to wait half a second before we get the full context
    - preprocessing applied
      - if I need to do some complex transformation first to get the input to my model that will take time

- installing dependencies for laughter-gillick didn't work with my local python installation and venv

  - worked with conda though
  - cpu version of torch needs to be installed directly from the torch-website
    - see guide https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

- found a real-time-ish project on github

  - after a brief look at the code, this approach seems to wait for silence before outputting
    - that's not suitable for us -> latency way to high

- to load the checkpoint onto the cpu
  - documentation: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html

```
  checkpoint = torch.load(model_path+'/best.pth.tar', lambda storage, loc: storage)
  print(checkpoint.keys())
  model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['state_dict'])
```

- created `orange evals` - folder with orange-scripts for evaluation

  - 4 orange scripts up to now:
    - `general_evaluation` needs further editing
    - 2 scripts for looking at the segment length in Bmr031
    - `stats_with_different_min_length` needs further investigation
      - seems like the increased min_length almost doesn't change the number of predictions
        - do all the correct predictions lie in the transcribed segments that are quite long?
          - otherwise the number of 'valid' predictions should reduce bc all the shorter segments should be discarded...

- looked at paper results when trained on one dataset and evaluated on a different one
  - they still get recall values from 70-90%
  - check which parameters they used for min_length and threshold

# Tuesday-Wednesday, 16-17.11.21

- created aggregate laughter length plots
- created "aggregate predicted laughter length/aggregate transcribed laughter length"-ratio plots
  - possible next plot:
    - ratio of "recall/ratio-calculated-above"
      - states how much of the possible recall (defined by this ratio) was achieved

# Friday, 19.11.21

Real-time-factor calculation

- min_length parameter is only used in post processing (like threshhold)

  - thus it doesn't influence the calculation of the RTF (real-time-factor)
    - because it depends on prediction over the whole audio length and THEN filtering afterwards
    - BUT if the predictions have to happen in realtime, then it has an influence

# Tuesday, 14.12.21

- went through the code of Gillick et al. in more detail
- the two things I need to change and pass to the DataLoader are:
  1. train_df
  2. audio_hash: a mapping from audio_paths to the actual audio files

# Saturday 08.01.22

- using the train_df created yesterday and trying to use if with Gillick et al.'s model
- one error caused is the following:

  > ValueError: can't extend empty axis 0 using modes other than 'constant' or 'empty'

  - can be fixed by adding `pad_mode` parameter 'empty' to librosa.feature.melspectrogram()
    in audio_utils
  - this error was caused by an empty array being passed to the melspectrogram-function
    - I didn't fully understand why this happened
    - I moved the melspectrogram function into the dataloader itself and didn't get empty arrays
      - not sure why this was the case when the function in audio_utils was used

- current error happens in the forward pass:
  > running_mean should contain 448 elements not 64

# Sunday 09.01.22

- looked into audio-processing and audio-signal theory
  - helped to understand the different parts that audio signals are made up off and how
    features can be extracted from there
    - the videos looked at are from: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZPFjMe1uRSirmSpznqvJfQ
- fixed bug: current data loader was using the whole laugther segments - NOT the subsamples
  - after this change now all spectrograms are of the same shape
- fixed issue with wrong dimension from yesterday
  - problem seems to be the different sample rate of ICSI data
    - changing the sr to 8000 works
      - however, this isn't wanted -> unnecessary data loss
      - need to find a better way -> possibly adjusting the hop_length or NN-structure
- changed create_train_df.py script to create_data_df.py and adjusted to create three distinct dfs
  - one for training, one for validation, one for testing
  - need to load validation set in Gillick's train code
    - currently just using train_df as validation data

# Monday 10.01.22

- fixed Bug: Can now use the normal melspec function
  - problem was that the subsampled file passed to the melspec-function in audio utils was subsampled again
  - adjusted function in audio_utils accordingly
- adjusted create dfs script to also create 3 'dummy_dfs' only using the data from one meeting

  - this can be used for debugging

- training with dummy data seems to work. But seems like validation set is to small atm

  - val_batches_per_log = 0 which means that no batches are used for evaluation
    - currently the reason is that the number of validation samples is smaller than half of the batch size
      - thus, the division in torch_utils.py rounds to 0

- currently using the normal res_net without augmentation because I don't have noise audio files
  - check again how much worse the normal resnet performed in Gillick et al.'s paper

# Tuesday 11.01.22

Command used to run train.py on certain cluster node (here 'landonia12')
`sbatch -w landonia12 --array=1-1%10 cluster_scripts/laughter_train.sh cluster_scripts/experiment.txt --cpus-per-task=4 --gres=gpu4 --mem=8000`

- can be helpful if data is already present on disk of a certain machine

-Getting following error when trying to connect to MLP-cluster

```

- loaded data onto machines: **landonia12** and **landonia04**

# Wednesday 12.01.22

- Continued training

  - checkpointing works but training is really slow
    - only 30 batches in 2 hours (960 segments -> 8s audio processed per minute)
      - discussed this issue in the meeting for more details see meeting notes for 12.01.22

- Added another parameter to train.py: data_dfs_dir
  - allows to specify the dataframes used for train/val/test split
- **Some thoughts on training**
  - How did Knox and Mighafori train
    - is training with fixed 1s segments sensible?
  - random split vs. even split across meetings
  - balanced vs. imbalenced classes (speech vs. laughter)
  - does the melspec transformation run on GPU?
    - does any preprocessing run on GPU in their code?

# Saturday, 15.01.22

- updated store_all_icsi_audio.py script
  - added function to split the set of training folders into subsets
    - the whole training data couldn't be loaded into one hash

# Monday, 17.01.22:

- changed 'i_gpu' alias on mlp cluster to allows connecting to a specific node with default settings
- debugging why the training takes so long
  - when the training runs only ~20% of one GPU are used
    - is this because the GPU waits for the data to be ready -> the dataloading is the bottleneck?
    - started writing some code to evaluate dataloading
      - such evaluations will also go in my thesis as they show how I progressed and which issues I ran into
      - also mention the quality of the existing code in the thesis and how this made working with it more complicated

# Thursday, 20.01.22

- messaged with Ondrej about slow dataloading

  - he suggested that it might be due to shorter recording length in the switchboard dataset
    - this seems to be true:
      - 260 hours and 2400 conversations means 6.5min of average length for a recording
        - source: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97S62

- briefly looked into preloading data and storing them in a hash like Gillick et al.
  - decided against it as it seems to complicate the code even more
  - going with Ondrej's suggestion to write the dataloading from scratch
    - possibly using lhotse (https://lhotse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

# Friday, 21.01.22

- started looking at lhotse

  - they have a predefined recipe for ICSI-dataset to load data and transcripts into corresponding classes
    - Recording and Supervision class
  - the recipe contains a train/val/test split to minimise speaker overlap
    > This recipe, however, to be self-contained factors out training (67.5 hours), development (2.2 hours
    > and evaluation (2.8 hours) sets in a way to minimise the speaker-overlap between different partitions,
    > and to avoid known issues with available recordings during evaluation. This recipe follows [2] where
    > dev and eval sets are making use of {Bmr021, Bns00} and {Bmr013, Bmr018, Bro021} meetings, respectively.
    - https://github.com/lhotse-speech/lhotse/blob/master/lhotse/recipes/icsi.py

- why are the mic channels split into different types in the ICSI-recipe
  - even though the channels of different types are used to record people (according to preambles.mrt)
    - need to check if that has an impact on the results

```
MIC_TO_CHANNELS = {
    "ihm": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9], # we include 6 since it is used as back-off from some speakers for which no headset-mic exists
    "sdm": [6],
    "mdm": ["E", "F", 6, 7],
    "ihm-mix": [],
}
```

This mic to channel assignment is a bit confusing to me since according the preamble.mrt there are also people recorded on channel A and B (e.g. in meeting Bdb001)

# Saturday, 22.01.22

- Looked into Lhotse more closely

  - realised that icsi-recipe isn't part of current release
    - did some adjustments to icsi recipe to make it work

- important point about Lhotse usage: **Cut recordings first, then extract features and store them**:

  > We retrieve the arrays by loading the whole feature matrix from disk and selecting the relevant
  > region (e.g. specified by a cut). Therefore it makes sense to cut the recordings first,
  > and then extract the features for them to avoid loading unnecessary data from disk (especially for very long recordings).

- I find it rather confusing that the audio-dir is a required argument whereas the transcripts dir is not required

  - further, it seems like the audio dir could be the toplevel dir where the 'speech' and 'transcripts' folder reside in
    - I'd suggest that the audio-dir should be passed as the path to the 'speech' dir and the transcripts-dir should be passed as the path to the 'transcripts' dir
      - this would make it clearer for me

- Why does the recipe use integer IDs for the channels instead of the hexadecimal IDs used in the ICSI transcripts

  - is this more efficient?

- Some channels are missing in the MIC_TO_CHANNELS-dict: e.g. channelA and channelB
  - thus, they are not even downloaded which is clearly wrong

# Monday, 24.01.22

- according to this part of the lhotse docs (https://lhotse.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6_g/datasets.html), it's recommended to use precomputed features:
  > In general, pre-computed features can be greatly compressed (we achieve 70% size reduction with regard to un-compressed features), and so the I/O load on your computing infrastructure will be much smaller than if you read the recordings directly. This is especially valuable when working with network file systems (NFS) that are typically used in computational grids for storage. When your experiment is I/O bound, then it is best to use pre-computed features.

came up with following plan:

1. Split create_data_df to match the train/val/test split used by lhotse
2. load those data_dfs in lhotse data_loader script
3. create cuts for each in the data_dfs
4. Compute and store features for all these cuts in the format used by Gillick et al.
5. Create pytorch dataloader for these cuts, that loads the already computed feature from disk

- finished step 1 to 3
- step 4: computing and storing features works as well, making use of the CutSet.from_cuts

  - **Bug**: seems like passing 'num_jobs>1' to the `compute_and_store_features` function makes it run forever

  - alternatively one can pass a dict to the CutSet constructor
  - still need to work on creating the features that match Gillick et. al.'s code

- step 5: Running into some errors when using predefined dataset classes from lhotse

  - possibly need to write one myself
    - check these two jupyter notebooks for examples:
      1. https://colab.research.google.com/github/lhotse-speech/lhotse-speech.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/lhotse-introduction.ipynb#scrollTo=A2nhNy355NaF
      2. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HKSYPsWx_HoCdrnLpaPdYj5zwlPsM3NH?pli=1&authuser=1#scrollTo=Rx6Rhquw9Na0

- Getting correct shape with this FbankConfig:

  - first import using `from lhotse import FbankConfig`
  - `f2 = Fbank(FbankConfig(num_filters=128, frame_shift=0.02275))`
    - 0.2275 = 16 000 / 364 -> [frame_rate / hop_length]

- I probably need to create a custom feature extractor

  - check this part of the docs: https://lhotse.readthedocs.io/en/v0.12_cm/features.html#creating-custom-feature-extractor

- lhotse doc says there are two types of manifests but compute_and_store_features() only creates a single .lca file

  > There are two types of manifests:
  > one describing the feature extractor;
  > one describing the extracted feature matrices.
  > The feature extractor manifest is mapped to a Python configuration dataclass. An example for spectrogram:

  - in contrast, using save_audio creates a directory in which a recording/audio_file for each cut is stored
  - if you increase the num_jobs there are more than one file created (as many as there are workers)
    - but it also runs forever as described above
    - this doesn't seem to solve the issue because it doesn't create separate files per cut
      - **Fix**: This can be solved by passing the following paramter `storage_type=LilcomFilesWriter`
      - this stores each matrix in a single file
        - but all these files have random ids - how to find the feature representation of a specific segment?

- **Fix** problem with num_jobs was due to dev-version of lhotse

  - fix by using stable release and adding icsi.py to recipes folder and adding reference in **init**.py of recipes folder
    - currently using a symlink to the icsi.py in my own fork (located in HonoursProject folder)

# Tuesday, 25.01.22

Question from yesterday:

> but all these files have random ids - how to find the feature representation of a specific segment?

- **Answer**: The compute_and_store_features function returns a cutset that contains these ids mapped to the corresponding recording
  - this cutset needs to be passed to the dataset to create a dataset that has those information

**Question for meeting tomorrow**
What are the different dataloaders and dataset classes provided by Lhotse? Do you think I can use one of them?

# Wednesday, 26.01.22

- created a script to compare librosa audio loading from different offsets
  - `./laughter_detection/misc_scripts/check_librosa_loading_times.py`
  - found out that the loading time is proportional to the offset
    - for table, see `./Meeting_Notes/26_01_22/Meeting_26_01_22.pdf`

# Friday, 28.01.22

Microphone Abbreviation Meaning:

- ihm: Individual Head Microphone
- mdm: Medium Distance Microphone?
- sdm: Short Distance Microphone?

- Created pull request with added IHM channels

- Possibly fix this issue from worklog 22.01.22 and create a PR?:

```
- I find it rather confusing that the audio-dir is a required argument whereas the transcripts dir is not required

  - further, it seems like the audio dir could be the toplevel dir where the 'speech' and 'transcripts' folder reside in
    - I'd suggest that the audio-dir should be passed as the path to the 'speech' dir and the transcripts-dir should be passed as the path to the 'transcripts' dir
      - this would make it clearer for me
```

- stored chan_to_idx map on disk such that I can reload it from there and use the standard lhotse recipe without modifying it

  - before I modiefied the prepare_icsi function to also return the chan_to_idx map

- problem with num_workers seems to be present again

  - possibly look into this

- found way to store cutsets as .jsonl file

  - cutset.to_jsonl(<path>) / cutset.from_json(<path>)

- I ran into an issue with loading the cutset (with precomputed features) from disk instead of recomputing them

  - I wondered why the changes didn't work but I just reloaded the cutset from disk which had the wrong supervisions

- Created LadDataset (Laugh Activity Detection) which is a modiefied version of Lhotse's VadDataset
- created a supervision segment for each cut containing the information if the segment is laughter or not

# Monday, 31.01.22

- added load_data.py and lad.py to jrgillick repo and use it in a modiefied train script called `train_lhotse.py`

  - this train script makes use of the lhotse dataloader
  - needed to make some adjustments to make it work, e.g.:
    - changing the way signals and labels are loaded from a batch (using 'inputs' and 'is_laugh' keys)
    - adding a dimension to fit the given structure by Gillick et al.

- first version works: 100 Epochs ran sucessfully and in reasonable time
  - used same set (of 226 segements) for training and online validation (-> not good, just proof of work)

# Tuesday, 01.02.22

- use the following command to install lhotse at the state of my icis-update commit as pip package:
  `pip install git+https://github.com/lhotse-speech/lhotse@f1b66b8a8db2ea93e87dcb9db3991f6dd473b89d`

- changed name from 'val' to 'dev' to match lhotse's naming scheme

- got the following warnings when manifests for the whole ICSI data were created:

Write cutset_dict to disk...
```

More expressive tqdm output when running multiple workers would be useful

- atm it just shows the number of workers that have completed which doesn't give a good estimate of how long one worker will take to finish

`compute_and_store_features` is a function of the CutSet class which calls the `extract_from_samples_and_store` of the extractor-instance passed to it

- The `FeatureExtractor` class is an abstract class that defines the structure of all FeatureExtractors

  - a feature extractor is initialised by passing a config object (a dataclass) to the init-function

- added script for downloading dummy data to repo for easier debugging on different machines

- the shape we are looking for is (44,128)

- why does it sometimes work with multiple jobs and sometimes it doesn't

  - in function `compute_and_store_features`
  - first thought it might be the Config that is passed to the Fbank extractor - but using the normal Fbank() without config still doesn't work

- some parameters in the FbankConfig are the problem
  - they seem to stop the execution when num_jobs > 1 is used
  - opened issue on github: https://github.com/lhotse-speech/lhotse/issues/559
